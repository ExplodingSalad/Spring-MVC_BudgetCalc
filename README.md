A small project to test Spring MVC capabilities for Web Development purposes. You may enter your expense names 
and categorize them. Add an amount per expense and hit the calculate button. A grouped total of your expenses will
be displayed. A live version can be found here https://simplebudgetcalc.herokuapp.com/ (please allow some seconds for the server to spin up)
